# arpwn
Simple bash script for arpspoofing

I got tired of opening multiple terminals to effectively arpspoof a target, so I decided to write a bash script automating the process. I still need to tinker a few things around but for the most part it is working. I kind of went a little overboard with this, but I was having fun. I will also use any excuse possible to incorporate ASCII art.
